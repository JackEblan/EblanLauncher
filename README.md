## Eblan Launcher

**Eblan Launcher** is a custom Android Launcher made from scratch using Kotlin, Coroutines and Jetpack Compose.

## Why?
Most Android launchers are just forks of AOSPâ€™s Launcher3. I wanted to try something differentâ€”building from scratch while welcoming new developers and applying solid coding principles and best practices to keep the project alive for the long run.

Open-source Launcher3 forks often end up abandoned because of their complexity, making it tough for newcomers to contribute. And, not gonna lieâ€¦ a lot of them are still written in Java and rely on legacy APIs ðŸ¤£.
