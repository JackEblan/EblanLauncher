- Fix: Items on the dock becomes small on drag screen
- Perf: Experimental Settings to enable/disable sync

What is Data Sync?
- Disabling background sync helps save a bit of memory and keeps things lighter, but it also means Eblan Launcher won’t automatically update your apps, widgets, or shortcuts. Your app drawer might show outdated icons, missing widgets, or shortcuts that no longer work. Only turn this off if you rarely change your apps and don’t mind syncing manually from Settings when needed.

Note: If you recently updated from a previous version, data sync might be disabled. To enable it again, go to Experimental Settings.
