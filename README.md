# About The Project

Most Android launchers are just forks of AOSP’s Launcher3. I wanted to try something
different—building from scratch while welcoming new developers and applying solid coding principles
and best practices to keep the project alive for the long run. Open-source Launcher3 forks often end
up abandoned because of their complexity, making it tough for newcomers to contribute. And, not
gonna lie… a lot of them are still written in Java and rely on legacy APIs.

Meanwhile, many closed-source launchers are starting to get greedy—locking features behind paywalls
and sneaking in trackers. My goal is to give everyone the joy of using powerful features without
compromising privacy.
